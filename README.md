# Buy and Sell Land Project

A simple land management system where users can list lands for sale, browse available properties, check locations, and set appointments.
This project can also be used as a **guide for building database systems**, showing how to connect Python with MySQL to create a functional management application.

## How It's Made

This project is built with **Python** for the application logic and **MySQL** for data storage.  
Python handles user interactions, CRUD operations, and business logic, while MySQL manages the database for storing land listings, user details, and appointments.  
The integration demonstrates how a Python application can interact with a relational database to create a functional property management system.
